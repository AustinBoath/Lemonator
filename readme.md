<h1> The Lemonator </h1>
<h2> by Austin Boath </h2>
<h3> About </h3>
<p> I made this simple text-based game. It is currently WIP and a project just to experiment with development. But, I am proud of it. </p>
<h3> Installation </h3>
<p> on Linux, use: </p>
<code>sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinBoath/Lemonator/main/install.sh</code>
<p> The bash script should do all the work for you. </p>
<br>
<p> Alternatively, on Windows download the repository to a folder & run it with Python in CMD. Should be similar on MacOS </p>
